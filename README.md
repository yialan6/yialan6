### Hi there! My name is Alan and I am a second year Computer Science at UC Irvine aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer.  

My main goals right now are:  
- to gain proficiency in useful frameworks and technologies commonly used in the tech industry.
- to improve my imterpersonal skills and gain experience in working in a team environment.
- to explore more tech-related fields that I find interest in (Front-End, ML, Security)  

Currently, I am working on an ecommerce page to gain experience in working with backend databases and developing an intuitive front-end. I am using *Django* to dynamically process back-end data from a *SQL* database and displaying it into a front-end platform designed in HTML.

If you would like to get in touch, you can find me on [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-yi-14003b225/) or you can email me at [link](yi.alan10@gmail.com)
