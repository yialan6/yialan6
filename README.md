## Hi there! I'm Alan, a second year CS student @ UC Irvine

My main **goals** right now are:
- to gain proficiency in useful frameworks and technologies commonly used in the tech industry.
- to improve my imterpersonal skills and gain experience in working in a team environment.
- to explore more tech-related fields that I find interest in (Front-End, ML, Fintech)  

Currently, I am working on a marketplace page to gain experience in working with backend databases. I am using *Django* to process back-end data from a *SQL* database and displaying it into a front-end platform designed in HTML.

If you would like to get in touch, you can find me on [Linkdin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-yi-14003b225/) or you can send me an [email](yi.alan10@gmail.com).
